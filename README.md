# Pepipost as Email-scale-tester üèã 

## Introduction 
  
   Pepipost is well-known for his fastest ai-powered Email delivery engine with the statistics :chart_with_upwards_trend: of delivering emails to inbox :mailbox_with_mail: within 5 seconds. our customers sends about 7 bn+ emails every month with higher rate of inbox delivery with respective to time. 
  
   Moreover the same can be tested by sending emails from different medium,SDK and open APIs. But this will require multiple effort  inorder to execute the same. So, Pepipost being on mission for helping our developer friends we are making an open source Email-scale-tester :email::zap:

  options are
  -h        host of smtpmail
  -P        Port no you want to connect
  -t        to emailid for load testing (it varies from client to client)
  -tmails   total no of mails you need to test 
  -n        no of parallel node you want to trigger
  
  Output 
  connection time :: 0.100ms          time taken for connection
  sending speed   :: 100 mails/sec    time taken in seconds/mintues for sending email
  network speed   :: 10 mbps          network speed while testing
  ```
  
  * APIs Scale tester
  
  ```bash
  pepi-api-scaler -h 'https://api.sommething.com/sendemail/' -f 'something@mydomain.com' -t 'anything@sink.pepipost.com' -tmails 100000 -n 10
